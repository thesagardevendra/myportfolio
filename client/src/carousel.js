Hi Tejas and Abhishek,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

We have reviewed various requirements, and some functionalities are directly supported by Salesforce. However, we need to discuss the development of custom reports. Specifically, we need to introduce new fields during report generation and perform arithmetic operations on these fields.

Additionally, I have assigned various tasks to Abhishek, and he has developed and provided the required outputs.

Could you please confirm if it is feasible to develop these custom reports? Additionally, we would appreciate it if you could outline the possible approaches to achieve this.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Sagar
